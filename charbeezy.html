   <p>Bears are iconic mammals with a complex evolutionary history. Natural bear hybrids and studies of few nuclear genes indicate that gene flow among bears may be more common than expected and not limited to polar and brown bears. Here we present a genome analysis of the bear family with representatives of all living species. Phylogenomic analyses of 869 mega base pairs divided into 18,621 genome fragments yielded a well-resolved coalescent species tree despite signals for extensive gene flow across species.</p>

    <p>The gait of the giraffe is a pace (both legs on one side move together). In a gallop, it pushes off with the hind legs, and the front legs come down almost together, but no two hooves touch the ground at the same time. The neck flexes so that balance is maintained. Speeds of 50 km (31 miles) per hour can be maintained for several kilometres, but 60 km (37 miles) per hour can be attained over short distances. Arabs say of a good horse that it can “outpace a giraffe.”

        Cubs are born with a spotted coat and blue-grey eyes which open shortly after birth. Their eyes change colour to amber at 2 to 3 months, and the spotted coat fades with age – although faint spots on the belly and legs can persist into adulthood. Like humans, lions are born without teeth: cubs’ milk teeth erupt when they are around a month old, and are replaced with adult teeth as they get older. Cubs are also born without tail tufts, and young males only start to develop their mane at around 6 months old.</p>

        <p>One of the most damaging – but most invisible – threats they must overcome while navigating the hazards of daily life in the Anthropocene is the slow, steady deterioration of the habitats they rely on for food and shelter. As demand for pastures and cropland has grown, Central America has lost some eighty percent of its native vegetation. In the last twenty years alone, Nicaragua has lost more than 20 percent of its native forest cover. The forests that do remain have become fragmented, islands of habitat separated by wide swaths of city, suburb, and farmland.</p>

    <p>The alligator uses its powerful tail to propel itself through water. While alligators move very quickly in water, they are generally slow-moving on land. They can, however, move quickly for short distances. Alligators are a keystone species benefiting the marshes, swamps, rivers and lakes where they live and many other species found within their natural community.</p>
